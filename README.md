Maria Hughes - Soprano

- This is a professional singing page for myself. This is an overview of what the "Maria Hughes Soprano" brand has to offer in a snapshot. 
- This therefore really inspired my brochure type approach to my first milestone project. 
- This page gives prospective employers a look at some of my work experience, it also gives them a little insight to what I look and sound like and what I can offer on stage.
- This project also gives the opportunity to make contact with me through the contact form on the project.



UX

- With this project visually I wanted to keep things as simple as possible. I knew that the images I had planned to use in the project were very busy so I wanted to keep the rest as unfussy as possible.
- I chose the black and white colours to allow the colours of the images to really pop.
- I really like the use of the thick black boarders I used around my headings and contact file. I feel like it gives a little lift of animation and gives the project quite an edgy feel to it. 
- As previously stated I wanted this project to be a snapshot of my brand, so I wanted the whole site to be somewhat like a brochure. A quick snapshot of what Maria Hughes Soprano can do.
- I used Figma as my wireframe template to help in the development of my project. Here is a link to my wireframe:  https://www.figma.com/file/VE3eHnwZb2Hsnxjvd1JPeo/Untitled?node-id=1%3A2
- I like the accessibility of a brochure. Everything you need to know at a moments glance. So with this brochure style idea in mind I put that first title, head shot picture at the top to articulate who I was and what I was about, then followed on with the back and forth across the page sections of the media and gallery. Followed then by a very clear and concise place to make contact right at the bottom of the page.
- When doing any external links I always made sure to use the "_blank" target so as to open in a new page and not draw the user away from the main focus of my page.



Features

- Nav Bar : This is located at the top of the page at all times. I achieved this by using the bootstrap class of "fixed-top". In the navbar on the left is a h4 with a name and title. On the right I have put the four section headings with clickable anchor href links to each section.
- Title Section : This section has a title headshot with a name and title again.
- About Section : In this section is a short biography and a performance picture of Maria Hughes Soprano.
- Media Section: In this section again there is a promo picture of Maria Hughes along with clickable links to youtube media videos containing sound clips of Maria singing.
- Gallery Section : This section contains some performamce pictures and headshots from various productions Maria has done through the years.
- Footer : This section is used more so for the asthetic of the project. I feel that thick black line really finishes off the overall look of the whole site.



Existing Features

 - Clicking "About" on the navbar allows the user to skip straight to the about section.
 - Clicking "Media" on the navbar allows the user to skip straight to the media section.
 - Clicking "Gallery" on the navbar allows the user to skip straight to the gallery section.
 - Clicking "Contact" on the navbar allows the user to skip straight to the contact section.
 - Within the media section there are two icons buttons that if you click on them brings you to external youtube links to listen to a sound file of Maria.
 - Within the contact section there is an option to fill in a contact form that has options to put in your name, email address and leave a message. By clicking on the "get in touch" button this then sends your message and information to Maria.

Future Features

- In the future I might introduce a clickable feature to social media accounts. 
- Also as Maria's career develops I will be adding more up to date information along with new images and media.



Technologies Used

Languages Used:
- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap 
- Figma
- Google fonts



Tutorial Sources:
- I have used the mini project in Bootstrap 4 substantially as a guide for the framework of my project.

- w3docs
- flexbox
- w3schools
    - I used these sources alot to guide me and give me inspiration for problem solving along the way.

Bootstrap:
- I used Bootstrap to create the layout for my grid system, my media cards and contact form. I did over write some of this though to help me create the vision I desired.
- I discovered the "!important" tag also during this project and found it was an invaluable asset when overwriting bootstrap code.
- I also really got to grips with how usedful the "container" target is when doing a project like mine as it always aids me in keeping my sections tidy.




Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
