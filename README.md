Maria Hughes - Soprano

- This is a professional singing page for myself. This is an overview of what the "Maria Hughes Soprano" brand has to offer in a snapshot. 
- This therefore really inspired my brochure type approach to my first milestone project. 
- This page gives prospective employers a look at some of my work experience, it also gives them a little insight to what I look and sound like and what I can offer on stage.
- This project also gives the opportunity to make contact with me through the contact form on the project.



UX

- With this project visually I wanted to keep things as simple as possible. I knew that the images I had planned to use in the project were very busy so I wanted to keep the rest as unfussy as possible.
- I chose the black and white colours to allow the colours of the images to really pop.
- I really like the use of the thick black boarders I used around my headings and contact file. I feel like it gives a little lift of animation and gives the project quite an edgy feel to it. 
- As previously stated I wanted this project to be a snapshot of my brand, so I wanted the whole site to be somewhat like a brochure. A quick snapshot of what Maria Hughes Soprano can do.
- I used Figma as my wireframe template to help in the development of my project. Here is a link to my wireframe:  https://www.figma.com/file/VE3eHnwZb2Hsnxjvd1JPeo/Untitled?node-id=1%3A2
- I like the accessibility of a brochure. Everything you need to know at a moments glance. So with this brochure style idea in mind I put that first title, head shot picture at the top to articulate who I was and what I was about, then followed on with the back and forth across the page sections of the media and gallery. Followed then by a very clear and concise place to make contact right at the bottom of the page.
- When doing any external links I always made sure to use the "_blank" target so as to open in a new page and not draw the user away from the main focus of my page.



Features

- Nav Bar : This is located at the top of the page at all times. I achieved this by using the bootstrap class of "fixed-top". In the navbar on the left is a h4 with a name and title. On the right I have put the four section headings with clickable anchor href links to each section.
- Title Section : This section has a title headshot with a name and title again.
- About Section : In this section is a short biography and a performance picture of Maria Hughes Soprano with the title "About".
- Media Section: In this section again there is a promo picture of Maria Hughes with the title "Media" along with clickable links to youtube videos containing sound clips of Maria singing and a promotion clip of a performance of Carmen performed by Opera Theatre Company.
- Gallery Section : This section contains some performamce pictures and headshots from various productions Maria has done through the years.
- Footer : This section is used more so for the asthetic of the project. I feel that thick black line really finishes off the overall look of the whole site.



Existing Features

 - Clicking "About" on the navbar allows the user to skip straight to the about section.
 - Clicking "Media" on the navbar allows the user to skip straight to the media section.
 - Clicking "Gallery" on the navbar allows the user to skip straight to the gallery section.
 - Clicking "Contact" on the navbar allows the user to skip straight to the contact section.
 - Within the media section there are two icons buttons that if you click on them brings you to external youtube links to listen to a sound file of Maria.
 - Within the contact section there is an option to fill in a contact form that has options to put in your name, email address and leave a message. By clicking on the "get in touch" button this then sends your message and information to Maria.

Future Features

- In the future I might introduce a clickable feature to social media accounts. 
- Also as Maria's career develops I will be adding more up to date information along with new images and media.



Technologies Used

Languages Used:
- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap 
- Figma
- Google fonts



Tutorial Sources:
- I have used the mini project in Bootstrap 4 substantially as a guide for the framework of my project.
- I also referred back to the mini project "Love Running" for guidance.
- w3docs
- flexbox
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDpCejbl1sU&t=1537s
- w3schools
    - I used these sources alot to guide me and give me inspiration for problem solving along the way.

Bootstrap:
- I used Bootstrap to create the layout for my grid system, my gallery, my media cards and contact form. I did over write some of this though to help me create the vision I desired.
- I discovered the "!important" tag also during this project and found it was an invaluable asset when overwriting bootstrap code.
- I also really got to grips with how usedful the "container" target is when doing a project like mine as it always aids me in keeping my sections tidy.



Testing

- Throughout this entire project my go to for checking errors in my code was W3C Markup Validation Service: https://validator.w3.org/ . I am able to copy my HTML code into this to flag an errors I might have along the way. This includes a final check before finalising a project.

- Uponing opening my website you first see a title page with a picture and title of Maria Hughes Soprano. Across the top of the screen is a navigational bar again with the title Maria Hughes Soprano on the left had side and four clickable buttons on the right hand side that include;  "About" - This gets you to the section of the page that includes the bio of Maria, "Media" - This gets you to the section that includes clickable links to Youtube sound recordings of Maria, "Gallery" - This brings you to a section that includes 6 images including pictures of past performances, headshots and promotional shots, "Contact"- This brings you to contact form should you wish to make contact.

    - The nav bar remains the the same just a bit more compact.

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
